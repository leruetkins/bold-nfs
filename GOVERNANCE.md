# Governance

## Project Maintainers

This project is maintained by a team of volunteers. The current maintainers are:

- [Michael Schilonka] - Project Lead

## Decision Making

Major decisions about the project are made by the maintainers. These include:

- Architectural changes
- Breaking changes to the API
- Adding or removing features
- Changes to the development process
- Licensing and legal matters

For smaller decisions, maintainers may make decisions independently, but should be prepared to discuss and justify their choices if questioned by other contributors.

## Contribution Process

Anyone can contribute to the project by:

1. Opening issues to report bugs or request features
2. Submitting pull requests with improvements
3. Participating in discussions on existing issues and pull requests
4. Helping to review pull requests from other contributors

All contributions are welcome, but maintainers reserve the right to accept or reject any contribution based on its merits and alignment with the project's goals.

## Code Review Process

All pull requests must be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer before being merged. For significant changes, multiple maintainers may need to review and approve the changes.

Reviewers should focus on:

- Correctness and quality of the code
- Adherence to the project's coding standards
- Compatibility with existing functionality
- Adequate test coverage
- Clear documentation

## Release Process

Releases are made by the maintainers when significant changes have been accumulated or important bugs have been fixed. The release process includes:

1. Updating the version number in accordance with semantic versioning
2. Creating a changelog entry summarizing the changes
3. Creating a Git tag for the release
4. Publishing the release to package repositories if applicable

## Conflict Resolution

In the event of disagreements or conflicts:

1. Participants should first try to resolve the issue through discussion
2. If participants cannot reach consensus, maintainers may make a binding decision
3. Decisions should be documented and the reasoning explained
4. Those who disagree with a decision may fork the project under the terms of the license

## Changes to this Document

This governance document may be updated by the maintainers as needed. Significant changes should be discussed with the community before implementation.
